# SC-7(3) Access Points

> **Enhancement of:** SC-7

## High-Level Description

**Family:** System and Communications Protection (SC)
**Framework:** NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5

Limiting the number of external network connections facilitates monitoring of inbound and outbound communications traffic. The Trusted Internet Connection [DHS TIC](#4f42ee6e-86cc-403b-a51f-76c2b4f81b54) initiative is an example of a federal guideline that requires limits on the number of external network connections. Limiting the number of external network connections to the system is important during transition periods from older to newer technologies (e.g., transitioning from IPv4 to IPv6 network protocols). Such transitions may require implementing the older and newer technologies simultaneously during the transition period and thus increase the number of access points to the system.

## What to Check

- [ ] Verify SC-7(3) Access Points is documented in SSP
- [ ] Confirm control is operating effectively
- [ ] Review evidence of continuous monitoring for SC-7(3)
- [ ] Verify enhancement builds upon base control SC-7

## How to Test

### Step 1: Review Documentation

Examine the System Security Plan (SSP) and related artifacts for SC-7(3) implementation details. Verify the organization has documented how this control is satisfied.

### Step 2: Validate Implementation

```
# For cloud environments, use cloud-audit-mcp tools
# For on-premises, review system configurations directly

# Example: Check if account management policies exist
grep -r "account.management\|access.control" /etc/security/ 2>/dev/null
```

### Step 3: Test Operating Effectiveness

Verify the control is actively functioning, not just documented. Check logs, configurations, and operational evidence.

## Tools

| Tool | Purpose | Usage |
| ---- | ------- | ----- |
| cloud-audit-mcp | Check encryption and network controls | `cloud_audit_encryption` |
| nmap | Network scanning | `nmap -sV --script ssl-enum-ciphers` |

## Remediation Guide

### Control Statement

Limit the number of external network connections to the system.

### Implementation Guidance

Limiting the number of external network connections facilitates monitoring of inbound and outbound communications traffic. The Trusted Internet Connection [DHS TIC](#4f42ee6e-86cc-403b-a51f-76c2b4f81b54) initiative is an example of a federal guideline that requires limits on the number of external network connections.

Such transitions may require implementing the older and newer technologies simultaneously during the transition period and thus increase the number of access points to the system.
