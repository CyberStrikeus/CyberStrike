# 6.1.3 Ensure permissions on /etc/group are configured (Automated)

## Profile

- Level 1 - Server
- Level 1 - Workstation

## Description

The `/etc/group` file contains a list of all the valid groups defined in the system. The command below allows read/write access for root and read access for everyone else.

## Rationale

The `/etc/group` file needs to be protected from unauthorized changes by non-privileged users, but needs to be readable as this information is used with many non-privileged programs.

## Audit Procedure

### Command Line

Run the following command to verify `/etc/group` is mode 644 or more restrictive, `Uid` is `0/root` and `Gid` is `0/root`:

```bash
# stat -Lc 'Access: (%#a/%A) Uid: ( %u/ %U) Gid: ( %g/ %G)' /etc/group
```

## Expected Result

```
Access: (0644/-rw-r--r--) Uid: ( 0/ root) Gid: ( 0/ root)
```

## Remediation

### Command Line

Run the following commands to remove excess permissions, set owner, and set group on `/etc/group`:

```bash
# chmod u-x,go-wx /etc/group
# chown root:root /etc/group
```

## Default Value

Access: (0644/-rw-r--r--) Uid: ( 0/ root) Gid: ( 0/ root)
